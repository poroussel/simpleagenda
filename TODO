In no particular order :

* redesign networking : using NRURLHandle isn't really encourgaged but
  NSURLConnection doesn't accept PROPFIND and other webdav extensions
  without implementing our own subclass of NSURLProtocol, mimikcing
  _NSHTTPURLProtocol which seems like a waste of effort...

  using NSURLSession would be the modern solution but I'm not sure
  it would need the same NSURLProtocol subclass and it seems to
  also require block usage, not sure how to do that without clang
  and libobjc2

* only store passwords if the user asks for it

* month view

* build a framework to allow other applications to access the data ?
   (or let somebody else implement Apple Calendar framework)
