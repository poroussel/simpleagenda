Debugging

In case you need to debug SimpleAgenda you can activate debug logs by starting
the program from the command line using the --GNU-Debug option. This mechanism
allows activating logs for specific keys, usually class names. For example to
see more logs about alarms you can use this :

    SimpleAgenda --GNU-Debug=AlarmManager

Currently the following keys are usable :

 * AlarmManager
 * WebDAVResource
 * SimpleAgenda
 * SoundBackend
 * DBusBackend
 * GroupDAVStore
 * InvocationOperation
 * iCalTree

You can specify multiple keys by repeating --GNU-Debug options :

    SimpleAgenda --GNU-Debug=AlarmManager --GNU-Debug=WebDAVResource
