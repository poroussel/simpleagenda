	  selected day cell is bezeled/pushed (was a bold font) and busy
	  days use a bold font (instead of a tick mark). Always show six
	  weeks with black text for the chosen month and white text for
	  the previous and next ones. Use a defined font size so that it
	  all fits whatever the user choose as a default size.
	* Day view : circle through appointments with TAB and edit the
	  selected one with enter
	* Day view : no more appointments overlapping. The algorithm is
	  not 100% correct, we might want to change that in the future
